How to use the KNN?
	(1) When to use it?
	It is not recommanded to use it.
	First, it's too slow in predict stage
	Second, it's result is not so good

	(2) How to use it?
	    test_tuple :=[[1,4],[1,5],[5,1],[5,2]]
    
	    create_class_knn (2, KNNHandle)
	    add_sample_class_knn (KNNHandle, test_tuple, Width1)
	    train_class_knn (KNNHandle, [], [])
	    set_params_class_knn (KNNHandle, ['method','k'], ['neighbors_distance',10])

	    classify_class_knn (KNNHandle, [2,3], Result, Rating)
	    
	    clear_class_knn (KNNHandle)
