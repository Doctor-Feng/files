What's is the CNN?
	1. The propose of the CNN?
		To subtract the feature of the image.
	2. How to substact the feature?
 		By the operation of convolution.
		
	3. What's the convolution?
		Different filters can detect different features.
		In the convolution filters, if the feature is similar, its effects will be enlarged.
		
	4. What's the difference between the BP and CNN networks?

		The input in the BP networks is usually a vector.
		And, the input in the CNN is always a image.
		So, we must reduce the dimension of the input to reduce time and calculation amount.
		
		However, the basic of the operations is similar:
		(1) The unput x, dot mulity weight W, and the bias
			W(T)*x + b
		(2) ADD together
		(3) non linear function (ReLU)
		However, The cnn will have to reduce its dimension
		(4) Pooling operation(Sub Sampling)
			Select the max value in the part of the sample image
			Stride 2
			From 4X4 to 2X2
	5. Whats the application of Conv?
		edges detection
		sharpen
		Blur
		...
